_Thank You, Arewa Data Science Academy!_

_I can’t thank you enough for this amazing opportunity. Your session has been a real eye-opener and has motivated me to dive deeper into programming and data science. Honestly, I used to think it was too late for me to start learning these things, but now I realize that this is the perfect time to begin. This journey will not only help me pick up programming skills but also sharpen my thinking, problem-solving abilities, and overall mindset._

**A big thank you to my mentors:**
1. Shamsudden Hussain
2. Dr. Falalu
3. Dr. Idris
And many others who have guided and encouraged me.

**My plan for this fellowship**

_As the 2024 overall best graduating student from the Faculty of Engineering at Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil, I have a deep interest in exploring artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze data and make impactful predictions._
_Our world is facing huge challenges like flooding, droughts, rising temperatures, and unpredictable rainfall—all made worse by climate change. Industrial carbon emissions are a major factor, with about 5% of global emissions coming from the cement industry alone._
_My goal is to explore sustainable alternatives to cement in concrete, aiming to reduce its environmental impact. Using AI and machine learning models, I plan to analyze and optimize these alternatives for real-world application._
_This fellowship is the perfect opportunity for me to start learning and contributing to these critical issues._
